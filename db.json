      "paragraph1": "I recently had an appointment to have my hair colored and shared that I used a purifying shampoo the morning of my appointment. I received so many questions about why I did that in my DM‚Äôs on Instagram that I decided to break it all down here. 'I thought oily hair made the color stick better?'",
      "paragraph2": "‚ÄúMy stylist always told me dirty hair was better for coloring?‚Äù",
      "paragraph3": "‚ÄúWhy would you wash it if it‚Äôs just going to get washed at the salon?‚Äù",
      "paragraph4": "Before I dive in, I feel like I need to remind you that you need to listen to your own stylist if he or she directs you otherwise. I am a professional with years of experience (even though I‚Äôm not behind the chair right now) and this is my opinion.",
      "paragraph5": "If you are going to see your stylist for a haircut, it‚Äôs not necessary to wash your hair. The only case that could justify washing your hair is if it‚Äôs loaded up with dry shampoo or texture spray and it will be too challenging to brush out. In that case, it could be really helpful for you to wash it and brush it out yourself. If you are going to see your stylist for color, it‚Äôs better to arrive with clean, dry hair. The reason behind this is that it preps the hair to fully absorb whatever color service you are having done without the barrier of dry shampoo, texture powder, oil, etc. If your hair is covered in hair product (which is a chemical), how do you expect the hair color (also a chemical) to respond? In most cases, it‚Äôll all work out fine, but arriving at your appointment with clean dry hair gives the color the greatest opportunity for success.",
      "paragraph6": "Imagine painting on a canvas covered in dust, grime, and other junk. You could get the job done, but it may not be as pure as it would have been if the canvas was totally clean. So, if you‚Äôre able to wash your hair prior to getting it colored, even simply the night before, it‚Äôll certainly help set your stylist and the color up for success. If you aren‚Äôt able, your stylist should know whether or not he or she needs to prep your hair with a wash or if it‚Äôs safe to simply apply the color directly to your hair.",
      "paragraph7": "In order to avoid confusion, if you‚Äôre going in for JUST a haircut, it‚Äôs okay to skip washing prior to your appointment. Your stylist may prefer to cut your hair dry, or simply want to wash it themselves. Also, washing your hair and showing up to your appointment with wet hair will not lead to a lower price of the service either!"

      "paragraph4": "I always wash my hair after I get out of the pool. Sometimes immediately after, and other times it‚Äôll be a few hours after depending on what we have going on. I typically apply a hair mask or at the very least I‚Äôll add in a leave-in conditioner and let my hair air dry.",
      "paragraph5": "But before all of this, before I get in the sun, I take a few steps to take care of my hair. More often than not I‚Äôll wear a hat. And I just bought a few scarves on amazon to try this summer to cover my hair when I‚Äôm out by the pool. As far as hair products go, I love the Bumble and Bumble Hairdressers Invisible Oil UV protection line. I‚Äôve been using the primer for months, and really love the hyaluronic acid leave-in treatment too. I also rounded up a few other UV protection hair products to pack in your pool or beach bag this summer and included a recommendation for what to apply afterward too."

I like dry shampoo, I do, but I think a bit more education and awareness about it could help make the use of it better for hair and scalp health! As always, your personal hairstylist is the best option for discussing your scalp health, dry shampoo use, etc. since that person sees you regularly. I hope this post gives you a few tips, and you leave with a recommendation or two for dry shampoo!",
      "paragraph2": "Dry shampoo is a really fantastic option for extending the life of your hairstyle to skip a wash day. Not only is this a time-saver, but it can save your hair from a bit of heat styling as well! There are so many different kinds, and it really takes a bit of trial and error to find a system that works for you. Dry shampoo can help soak up oil, leaving the hair both feeling and looking cleaner, as well as adding a little lift and texture to the roots of your hair. I‚Äôve never loved dry shampoo. It‚Äôs FINE, but I‚Äôve always leaned more towards making time for a wash and fresh style instead of trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù two-day-old hair. Call me old-fashioned, but it‚Äôs just what I preferred.",
      "paragraph3": "I did discover a product that I really loved in the summer months a few years ago by Bumble and Bumble which was the perfect post-workout ‚Äúdry‚Äù shampoo mist. I used quotation marks because it was a wet spray, but dang it really helped refresh my hair to a manageable level after a very, very sweaty workout. The Pret-a-Powder Post Workout Dry Shampoo mist was my go-to to spray on my sweaty hair, let it sit, and then blow dry on a day I wasn‚Äôt interested in styling my hair. Usually, it was in a ponytail anyway, but that product helped it look better. It does have a strong scent, so keep that in mind.  Over time, I would occasionally, and I mean occasionally, use dry shampoo, but I never felt super attached to it.",
      "paragraph4": "I was at a hair appointment a few months ago and my stylist wondered out loud if I was burning my hair a bit through the use of heat, which was contributing to the darker blonde that would occur over time. I certainly use a lot of heat on my hair, but even with heat protection and deep conditioners and repairing treatments, the temperature of the tools can still dramatically affect your hair.",
      "paragraph5": "Living Proof Dry Shampoo ($28) ‚Äì it should shock no one that this was the clear winner for me. Living Proof has just absolutely nailed dry shampoo. It works, it makes my hair feel full and fresh, it‚Äôs got a light scent, and it didn‚Äôt cause my scalp to itch. I was so pleased with the volume that lasted all day from this dry shampoo. I know they have the Advanced Clean Dry Shampoo as well, which I haven‚Äôt tried yet but people seem to really love it.",
      "paragraph6": "Amika Perk Up Dry Shampoo ($26) ‚Äì this is a really nice option for someone who found Living Proof Dry Shampoo to be too intense/gritty. This feels like nothing in your hair, in the best way possible, but don‚Äôt expect it to add volume or lift.",
      "paragraph7": "Batiste Dry Shampoo, Bare Fragrance (under $10) ‚Äì this was another great option for a barely-there scent and lightweight finish. I got zero lift/volume from this product, so if you‚Äôre not looking for volume on day 2 or 3, and prefer a minimal scent, this would be a nice option!"

      "paragraph2": "I feel very comfortable making waves with a curling iron, but I wanted to push myself out of my ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù mode and create some soft, undone waves with the flat iron.",
      "paragraph3": "I‚Äôve been using GHD flat irons for years, both in the salon and at home, and while they don‚Äôt give you options to adjust heat, they are some of the fastest, smoothest, highest-performing irons out there.",
      "paragraph4": "I used the new GHD Platinum+ iron for these waves (this is not a sponsored post, but the brand did gift me this iron). It‚Äôs fantastic. It has a top heat of 365 degrees, which is safe for most hair, and an auto-shutoff after 30 minutes. The beveled edge of the plates means it smooths through the hair effortlessly, which is essential for a ‚Äúone and done‚Äù pass through the hair. Repeatedly ironing over a section of hair can cause damage, so if you‚Äôre able to get a smooth, straight effect (or a wave!) with one glide against the hair, that‚Äôs a sign of a great iron.",
      "paragraph5": "In the video, I used the GHD Platinum+ iron, the Cricket Pro-35 comb, Virtue Healing Oil for the ends, and Amika Un.Done Volume and Matte Texture Spray for texture and grit. Prior to the start of the video, I used Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser‚Äôs Invisible Oil Ultra Rich Hyaluronic Treatment Lotion, as well as Aquage Uplifting Foam on my roots for lift.",
      "paragraph6": "In my experience, this is one of those hairstyles that looks different every time you try it. Some days it‚Äôs softer waves, other days you‚Äôll have a stronger bend. A lot depends on how you prep the hair, how quickly your iron flows through the sections, and what finishing products you use as well.",

      "paragraph1": "Human hair extensions are exactly what they sound like. They are made out of real, human hair from top to bottom, collected from a donor. Remy hair means all the cuticles (the outer layer of the hair) are intact, running in the same direction at the time of collection. This allows for almost no tangling and ensures that the extensions remain smooth and silky throughout their lifetime.  Synthetic hair, on the other hand, is made out of various synthetic, blended fibres, and contains no human hair. These fibres are usually very fine, plastic fibres that are manufactured to imitate real human hair.",
      "main2": "LOOK & FEEL",
      "paragraph2": "Both real and synthetic extensions come in many styles, colours, and different forms of application. The quality of synthetic fibres can vary, but they are generally stiff and move differently from human hair, so they don‚Äôt blend as well with your natural hair. They sometimes have a wiry or coarse feel to the touch. Real hair looks and feels real (because it is!) and therefore blends more naturally with your hair.  ",
      "main3": "COLORING & STYLING",
      "paragraph3": "Human hair extensions can be treated just like your own natural hair. You can straighten, curl, blow dry, color them, and apply hair products. With synthetic hair, you cannot color the hair as most dyes contain ammonia or bleach, which would destroy the synthetic hair. Additionally, you cannot style synthetic hair the same way as your real hair because heat can damage them so curling irons, straighteners and blow dryers are a no go, as they will melt or severely damage the hair. Other factors such as sun, friction, or harsh hair products can also damage synthetic hair extensions. ",
      "main4": "QUALITY & HOW LONG HAIR EXTENSIONS LAST",
      "paragraph4": "Synthetic hair is cheaper than real hair, but of course with that, comes a trade-off. Because they‚Äôre made out of synthetic fibres, they do not last as long as human hair as they can easily be damaged by the above-mentioned factors (sun, heat, etc.) Generally, synthetic hair extensions last for a few months, whereas human hair extensions can last upwards of one year if they are well taken care of. Luxy Hair remy human hair extensions last for about one year on average. "

      "paragraph1": "Because makeup brushes can be such a breeding ground for bacteria, Dr. King recommends washing makeup brushes and sponges at least once per week. ‚ÄúThis is a good policy for tools used in the delicate eye area, and particularly if the tools are used for liquid and cream-based products, which are more likely to become contaminated,‚Äù she says. For tools used with dry powders only (which she says are ‚Äúa more challenging environment for microbes to grow in‚Äù), and those concentrated on other areas of the face like the cheeks and brows, Dr. King says a slightly longer interval between washes is fine‚Äîbut you should still clean them at least every other week. The makeup artists we spoke with suggested the same. When they‚Äôre not working with clients (which requires cleaning after every job), New York‚Äìbased makeup artists Jennifer Nam and Marie Schumacher like to clean their personal brushes with soap water around once a week, and do touch-ups between with a brush-cleaning spray after each use (keep scrolling for suggestions on which to buy).

That being said, there are some clear-cut signs it‚Äôs time to throw away a brush. Much like split ends are a reliable sign you need a haircut, splitting brush hairs, or brush hairs falling out, indicate that it‚Äôs time for that brush to head into retirement, according to Nam and Gowers. Another sign is when your brush or makeup sponge begins to emit a foul smell. ‚ÄúWhen your Beautyblender is cracking, or smelling funky, you should replace it,‚Äù Gowers says.  To prolong the life of your brushes, Gowers also recommends cleaning the container that your makeup brushes sit in every once in a while. If you‚Äôre noticing that the bristles on your brushes are getting mangled from being stuffed in the same cramped container all the time, Nam recommends going the extra mile and slipping brush guards ($13, Beautylish) on your brushes to keep them in mint condition.

All of the makeup artists that we spoke with preferred to use liquid brush cleaners on their own brushes. One of Schumacher‚Äôs favorites is the Parian Spirit cleaner, which she uses for quick, daily cleanups. ‚ÄúIt removes and disinfects in one step,‚Äù she says.

My brushes don‚Äôt smell like chemicals, and they feel soft and ready to use again afterwards.‚Äù  Meanwhile, Gowers swears by Cinema Secrets, which is a concentrated, professional-grade option that lasts for a long time since a little goes a long way. ‚ÄúIf you use it properly,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a deeper clean than soap and water.‚Äù She also finds that the formula dries really quickly, preserves brushes longer, and conditions without leaving an oily sheen behind.",

      "paragraph6": "Holding your brushes with the bristles facing down, gently run lukewarm water in the sink and wet the tips of the bristles. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want the water to get inside the barrel of your brushes because over time it can break down the adhesive that is holding your brush together and possibly erode your brush handles if they are made of wood,‚Äù Nam says. Gowers also notes that you don‚Äôt want to fully submerge the brush bristles, and that you should avoid rinsing under hot water, ‚Äúwhich can loosen up the glue.‚Äù  Add a drop of your soap of choice to a textured cleansing pad (your palm works here as well), and swirl the brush in the soap until it‚Äôs fully lathered up and any pigment or dirt is removed. If you‚Äôre using bar soap, gently rub your makeup brush or sponge into the soap, creating a lather.  Gently squeeze your makeup brush or sponge to remove any excess cleanser or water. Rinse again with clean water, with the bristles facing downward. Gowers notes that again, you don‚Äôt want to fully submerge the brush bristles, and that you should avoid rinsing under hot water.",
      "paragraph7": "Gently squeeze out any excess water, and mold your bristles back into place so they will dry correctly. Lay your brushes flat to dry on a towel or paper towel. Schumacher says that when she does this step, she leaves the brush heads hanging over a table edge, ‚Äúso there‚Äôs air circulating around the entirety of the bristles.‚Äù This will also help your brush dry in its proper shape. Want to speed up the drying process? Nam likes to direct the breeze from a fan at her makeup brushes. Just make sure that you‚Äôre avoiding heat from devices like hair dryers, which can dry out the bristles."

      "paragraph1": "No, you're not terrible at makeup if you don't know how to use eye shadow. It's just that eye shadow looks can be extremely difficult to master. There are tens of thousands of tutorials online‚Äîif not more‚Äîthat can quickly become overwhelming. And if you're a newbie, applying eye shadow in a way that doesn't just look like you gave yourself a black (or pink‚Ä¶or blue) eye can be a complex and time-consuming process. Many demos detail steps that include applying a primer, a base color, a crease color, a highlight, a glitter‚Äîand on and on it goes. The 30-piece palettes in the beauty aisle don't help to simplify things, either. So we talked to Joey Maalouf, cofounder of The Glam App, and celebrity makeup artist Lindsay Ebbin, cofounder of BeYu Cosmetics, to parse through the classic eye shadow mistakes most people make. Read on to learn how to use eye shadow like you actually know what you're doing‚Äîbecause, after reading this, you will! ",
      "main2": "1. Mistake: You‚Äôre skipping primer.",
      "paragraph2": "Both of our experts agree that using eye shadow primer is an essential first step. ‚ÄúI think the biggest mistake people make is they don‚Äôt wear a primer or a cream shadow or some type of base before they apply a powdered eye shadow,‚Äù Maalouf tells SELF. Primer has many purposes: It can moisturize dry lids, it helps shadow stay on longer, and it acts like a magnet to stop loose shadow from falling on your cheeks. If you don‚Äôt want to purchase a separate product to put in your makeup kit, you can use a fragrance-free lip balm or salve, or any eye cream as a substitute.",
      "main3": "2. Mistake: You‚Äôre applying concealer to your lids before shadow.",
      "paragraph3": "While applying a primer is an important step, you can skip color correcting and concealing your lids if you‚Äôre going to apply shadow. ‚ÄúSometimes concealer is too cakey,‚Äù Maalouf says. ‚ÄúThen it changes the color of the eye shadow and it doesn‚Äôt look too good.‚Äù ",
      "main4": "3. Mistake: You‚Äôre applying eye makeup before foundation.",
      "paragraph4": "Both of our experts agree that it's best to apply foundation before any eye makeup. ‚ÄúI start with [taking care of the] skin because it takes the longest, and I think it‚Äôs most important,‚Äù Maalouf says. ‚ÄúInstead of using 19 eye shadows, make your skin look perfect and use one eye shadow.‚Äù",
      "main5": "4. Mistake: You‚Äôre buying nude shades that ‚Äúmatch‚Äù your skin tone.",
      "paragraph5": "It makes sense on paper: Buy a few nude shades, and they will coordinate with every look you have in mind. But in reality, that's not your best bet for an all-purpose makeup arsenal. In fact, you‚Äôre better off reaching for something metallic to really make your eyes stand out. ‚ÄúPeople get afraid of color, but sometimes a color can actually be less noticeable than a beige or brown,‚Äù Maalouf says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre instinctually going for your version of neutral, but a metallic bronze or rose gold can be really minimal.‚Äù ",
      "main6": "5. Mistake: You‚Äôre using only a makeup brush to apply eye shadow.",
      "paragraph6": "Brushes aren‚Äôt always required to get a good eye look‚Äîyour fingers are your greatest secret weapon, and can actually do a lot of things even a fancy brush can't. For best results, apply the shadow to the back of your hand first. Then use your middle finger (on your opposite hand) to pick up the product and swipe it across your lids. For a smoky eye effect, apply liner to your lash line and waterline. Then smudge with your index finger.",
      "main7": "6. Mistake: You think you need four different shades of eye shadow for a proper look.",
      "paragraph7": "Maalouf believes wholeheartedly in a minimal approach to eye shadow. So while those four-step tutorials on Pinterest are gorgeous, you can most definitely get away with using just one shadow shade. ‚ÄúTake a really fluffy eye shadow brush and a matte shadow a couple of shades darker than your natural skin,‚Äù Maalouf suggests. ‚ÄúThen do a haze around your whole eye. When you take your look from day to night, you can add an eyeliner to it.‚Äù That‚Äôs it! Bye, eye shadow palette."

The Ottoman style houses here, stacked up against the side of the mountain with their white washed walls and slate roofs make for a killer Albania photo moment on Instagram but stick around for a while and wander the small streets hunting out the best Cevapi (small sausage dish) in town. Gijirokastra castle, with is stunning views over the valley, cannons in cobbled hallways and plane wrecks is a great vantage point and was surprisingly free of tourists, even in August.

      "image1": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/2055389/pexels-photo-2055389.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1600",
      "paragraph1": "A good way to travel sustainably is to choose a smarter holiday destination. Many countries are working towards becoming carbon neutral and Bhutan is the first country to become carbon negative! It‚Äôs better not to follow the latest travel trends, based on popular movies or series. As an example, the Game of Thrones brought fame to Dubrovnik, Croatia. This caused problems for a destination that was not prepared for mass tourism. For instance, increased traffic, deterioration of historical sites, and increasing prices that are driving locals out.",
      "main2": "2. Research before booking",
      "paragraph2": "Research accommodations and tours, that you‚Äôre planning to book, based on how ‚Äògreen‚Äô they are. You can normally find this kind of information on their website. Booking responsibly is a positive way to travel sustainably. Many hotels are now involved in green travel programs or donate a percentage of their profits towards environmental action. For instance, Marriot is only using bulk dispensers in bathrooms, to eliminate single-use plastic. Even better, bring your own environmentally-friendly toiletries rather than using the hotel‚Äôs products at all.",
      "main3": "3. Avoid animal entertainment",
      "image3": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1000529/pexels-photo-1000529.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1600",
      "paragraph3": "Wildlife is one of the best parts of traveling. Sadly, 75% of all wildlife tourism has a negative effect on animals. Taking part in animal entertainment can mean anything as obvious as watching dolphins performing tricks, to riding an elephant. It also applies to entertainment that seems innocent, like feeding an eagle, holding a snake, or trying Luwak coffee. Animal welfare (riding animals) Companies may seem to promote the welfare of the animal. However, there is not enough research to support ‚Äòsafe or humane‚Äô riding of animals. Because of this, it‚Äôs a great idea to research animal-related activities beforehand. Animal feeding . Feeding wild animals is not a good idea, because they may become dependent on food supplies if they are fed by tourists. Looking after wildlife in these ways helps sustain travel for the future.",
      "main4": "4. Be respectful of the environment",

      "paragraph4": "Respecting the environment ensures the future of sustainable travel. Over time, beautiful natural areas are seeing the effects of mass tourism. For instance, avoid touching ancient temples and recognize that trails and fences are there for a reason. In short: read the signs. Coral bleaching is another worldwide problem. Due to this, only look at the corals from a distance and never touch them. By doing this, coral growth is hoped to increase.",

      "paragraph5": "Protect animals and sea life from getting entangled and ingesting plastic toxins, or even prevent microplastics from ending up in our food. It is a relatively simple task to throw your garbage in designated bins. Remember that plastic can take up to 1000 years to decompose! As a result, it‚Äôs best to use compostable alternatives, avoid buying plastic, or travel plastic-free. Positive action, such as picking up litter is a fantastic way to help. Beach clean-ups are happening all over the world, so have a look online to see where your nearest one is. This is a great way to be a part of positive change, help the community and meet new people who are interested in sustainable travel!"

      "paragraph2": "Fistral Beach in Newquay is one of the best surf spots in the UK. The wide, sandy beach is backed by dunes and faces the rugged Atlantic. Like many Cornish surfing beaches, Fistral‚Äôs west-facing direction exposes it to large swells, perfect for year-round surfing. Though often busy, the 750m-long beach accommodates surfers of all levels. Advanced surfers usually gather at the northern end of Fistral, which is more exposed and promises steeper, faster waves. The Cribbar, Newquay‚Äôs spectacular big wave, is a draw for surfers all over the world. Those less experienced should stick to the southern end of Fistral, which is sheltered somewhat by the Pentire headland. There are some excellent surf schools nearby which provide lessons for beginners. The beach is a few minutes‚Äô walk from the town centre and close to a range of Newquay cottages. Freshen up and head back out for dinner at Rick Stein or watch the sunset with a drink at the popular Fistral Beach Bar.",

Combined with a picturesque setting, sheltered waters and a sophisticated network of boat yards, marinas, sail makers and chandlers, it provides one of the UK‚Äôs best sailing destinations.  Aspiring sailors can take a range of courses, from RYA Level 1 to Advanced Seamanship. Those who just want to enjoy the scenery can book a day of sailing aboard a tall ship or a classic Cornish Gaff Cutter. On land, the town itself has plenty to offer.

      "paragraph4": "Coasteering has been described as everything you weren‚Äôt allowed to do by the sea when you were a child: scrambling up rock faces, exploring caves, leaping off ledges and diving into the sea. In essence, it involves exploring a coastline at sea level. Think nature trail with added adrenaline.  Coasteering originated among surfers who would scramble along coastlines in search of the best surf spots and later developed into its own sport. Cornwall has a wealth of options on both the north and south coast as well as inland quarries. The stretch from Praa Sands, past Rinsey to Porthleven, is particularly dramatic. Thrillseekers should ask about the engine houses of Wheal Trewavas mine as you may be able to coasteer into the old engine shaft! Back at sea level, look out for herring gulls, cormorants and shags.

      "paragraph5": "With its wealth of sheltered coves, Cornwall is a fantastic destination for stand up paddleboarding. Beginners should start at Carbis Bay Beach, a mile from St Ives. Unlike Fistral above, Carbis Bay doesn‚Äôt face west and is largely protected from the Atlantic swells. Expect golden sand and glassy water, but do bear in mind that this is the open sea and conditions can change dramatically depending on the weather.  A range of guided tours are available, from beginner classes to ‚Äòclinics‚Äô designed to correct poor technique. You can choose to head into the open water (expect rougher swells) or explore the coastline on a gentler jaunt.  There is much to do in Carbis Bay, but we advise staying in one of the cottages in St Ives and walking or driving in. The larger town will have more choice, especially in shoulder and low season when some bars and restaurants close. ",

It‚Äôs difficult to pinpoint exactly where to stay in Cornwall for the best walks, but you can‚Äôt go wrong with the Lizard Peninsula.  The Lizard Peninsula is the southerly tip of mainland Britain and the coast is accordingly rugged, hewn by the Atlantic. Clifftop walks abound, suitable for all abilities. We recommend The Lizard coastal walk, a 7mi (11km) loop that takes in some of Cornwall‚Äôs most dramatic landscapes, from the far-reaching views at Lizard Point to the coastal idyll of Kynance Cove.

We recommend the Penzance cycling loop (70km, 870m elevation gain), which covers some of Cornwall‚Äôs ‚Äì and the UK‚Äôs ‚Äì most famous sights. Starting from Penzance, it takes in the storybook village of Mousehole, the iconic landmark of Land‚Äôs End and the fairytale setting of St Michael‚Äôs Mount.

      "paragraph1": "Slow travel is actually a splendid offshoot of the slow food movement. The slow food movement arose in Italy during the 1980s as fast-food chains like McDonalds attempted to infiltrate and outcompete local businesses. Italy said, no ‚Äì but in Italian (which is really just an overly-emphatic ‚Äòno‚Äô with wild hand gestures), and the slow food movement was born. It emphasises a connection to place and valuing local businesses and their high-quality products over cheap, mass-produced food. Essentially, it‚Äôs a movement of quality over quantity.   Slow travel, then, is a f*ck you to the vacuous Insta-famous travel bloggers and their fast food take on travel. It‚Äôs about throwing your caution to the wind and travelling without a phone.  You prioritise connection with local people over another selfie with the Eiffel Tower. It‚Äôs about sitting in a hole in the wall store on tiny plastic chairs and trying the best soup you‚Äôve ever had in your life. As you look around, the smallest details create an imprint on your mind. So this is what travelling is about. It‚Äôs about writing your own manifesto. Slow travel is the whole reason you hit the road in the first place.",
      "main2": "Skip Your Itinerary",
      "paragraph2": "For me, there‚Äôs a mindset shift that is crucial to slow travel. My rigid itinerary would have me up at 6 am to try Trip Advisor‚Äôs best croissant and then shuttle on to the top 10 places you have to see before you die. You then rinse and repeat for 12 exhausting days. It‚Äôs a life-changing experience and then we go back to clocking in and out of the 9 ‚Äì 5. My slow travel itinerary would have me impulsively buy a bus ticket to a town I‚Äôd vaguely heard of. It gives you time to scour local newspapers for some part-time work. There‚Äôs time to learn the recipes of my housemates; eat at local restaurants. It‚Äôs about getting under the skin and becoming part of the fabric of the town. I let my travels genuinely change me.",
      "main3": "Why Should I Travel Slowly?",
      "paragraph3": "If the most simple way of describing slow travel is quality over quantity, then I think it becomes clear why you should do it ‚Äì to enhance the quality of your travels!

This need to travel glued to your phone and to tick off destinations keeps you in a constant state of stress. Now while the best travel pushes you, it shouldn‚Äôt leave you feeling like a pile of limp, wet noodles. The fact of the matter is, you are never going to see it all. So you might as well make what you do see worthwhile. Going back to the Great Barrier Reef example: rather than going on one scuba diving trip before flying back to your soul-crushing 9 ‚Äì 5, you could live in Cairns for a few months. You‚Äôre going to beat the travel blues by slowing down; by living somewhere and making a morning routine out of what most people consider a mere bucket list item.",

This led us to cram ourselves into these rigid little itineraries that leave no room for a regenerating planet ‚Äì or self. Luckily, we‚Äôve said ‚Äòno, it‚Äôs not a phase, mom‚Äô.

      "paragraph1": "I'‚Äôm obviously biased when it comes to my review of the Bonpoint collection, as my kids have been walking their show AND we are working together for some time now, but still, with the eye of a fashion enthusiast, I‚Äôm going to try to tell you about my favorite parts of the Bonpoint Spring-Summer 2019 show, and show you the best look worn by the cutest kids, and my James and Stella!  With Stella almost turning 5 ‚Äì and with that her growing personality and ideas on fashion ‚Äì it‚Äôs getting harder to get them in the looks that I want her in. That‚Äôs okay. She needs that space to explore and become who she is. We usually negotiate on who can pick the top, and then the other person picks the bottom, and so on. I think to a certain extent it‚Äôs okay to negotiate with your kids, just for the sake of peace and quiet. We all live busy lives, have busy jobs, and want to be at least a little representable when going on date night ‚Äì plus I like to hold off on the Botox for a little longer ‚Äì so we negotiate. Don‚Äôt confuse this with bribing! This I‚Äôm completely against, and sadly see this happening around me a lot. Of course I‚Äôve done it, and I might do it again, but trust me; those bribes were only to get that smoothie down, or take a bite of their broccoli. But It didn‚Äôt help, tears all over, never doing that again. Anyway, so my point is, it‚Äôs hard to get Stella into anything I like her to wear ‚Äì especially dresses ‚Äì yet when she walks the Bonpoint show she‚Äôs all in. She wants to wear it all, show it all, makes 500 more rounds during the finale and is telling me afterwards how much she loves it‚Ä¶ Right! I cherish this moment, and soak up this cute little naughty face wearing the CUTEST dresses on the planet, because let‚Äôs be honest, nobody does dresses better than Bonpoint‚Ä¶",

Aren‚Äôt they reminding you of those Chanel ones I showed on my instastories the other week? Exactly! And those I want so badly‚Ä¶ you have no idea! So, you can imagine, I‚Äôve been envying these little feet for a while now, while waiting for my size of the Chanel‚Äôs to get in! Also what really stood out for me, were the bags little plaid shoppers and the woven ones, the visors ‚Äì very Dior for kids ‚Äì and the perfect denim pieces! All the denim pants and jackets are like how I want to wear them, and the dress over jeans look ‚Äì which Stella will love, since she‚Äôs more into jeans than dresses as I mentioned ‚Äì is perfect! Needless to say, there are a thousand little details that I loved, and you see a lot of it in the ‚ÄúBackstage at the Bonpoint Spring-Summer 2019 show‚Äù post I shared earlier‚Ä¶ the hair of the little girls, with the ribbon in their braids, or the colours and patterns inspired by cultures from around the wold.

Starting with the latter; going to Paris with two little kids isn‚Äôt really that different from going to Paris as a couple. There are little implications, like you‚Äôre not going to have dinner past midnight, or drink wine in that little romantic Parisian bistro ‚Äì well, maybe one glass ‚Äì and I could argue renting an apartment instead of staying at a hotel, but considering our experience is that the French don‚Äôt mind ‚Äì well behaved ‚Äì kids in their restaurants or hotels, you can pretty much go wherever you used to go. French couples we know, with kids, didn‚Äôt completely change their lives either, after they have little ones. They just make sure their kids have the proper manners to be in a ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù environment, which I believe a lot of kids are lacking in New York City. Not really any offense to New Yorkers and their kids, or NYC restaurants, but I do find that when you live for example on the Upper West, there‚Äôs definitely certain places most parents go for dinner with their kids, because it‚Äôs a kid-friendly place. Yet, it‚Äôs not a necessarily a place where you want to go as a grown up. Anyway, my point is, just make sure they are raised with good table manners ‚Äì bring an iPad if you want to drink that last glass of wine ‚Äì and you are fine anywhere in Paris/France. To my French readers: Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong! I would love to hear your thoughts on this!
