            "paragraph1": "I recently had an appointment to have my hair colored and shared that I used a purifying shampoo the morning of my appointment. I received so many questions about why I did that in my DM‚Äôs on Instagram that I decided to break it all down here. 'I thought oily hair made the color stick better?'",
            "paragraph2": "‚ÄúMy stylist always told me dirty hair was better for coloring?‚Äù",
            "paragraph3": "‚ÄúWhy would you wash it if it‚Äôs just going to get washed at the salon?‚Äù",
            "paragraph4": "Before I dive in, I feel like I need to remind you that you need to listen to your own stylist if he or she directs you otherwise. I am a professional with years of experience (even though I‚Äôm not behind the chair right now) and this is my opinion.",
            "paragraph5": "If you are going to see your stylist for a haircut, it‚Äôs not necessary to wash your hair. The only case that could justify washing your hair is if it‚Äôs loaded up with dry shampoo or texture spray and it will be too challenging to brush out. In that case, it could be really helpful for you to wash it and brush it out yourself. If you are going to see your stylist for color, it‚Äôs better to arrive with clean, dry hair. The reason behind this is that it preps the hair to fully absorb whatever color service you are having done without the barrier of dry shampoo, texture powder, oil, etc. If your hair is covered in hair product (which is a chemical), how do you expect the hair color (also a chemical) to respond? In most cases, it‚Äôll all work out fine, but arriving at your appointment with clean dry hair gives the color the greatest opportunity for success.",
            "paragraph6": "Imagine painting on a canvas covered in dust, grime, and other junk. You could get the job done, but it may not be as pure as it would have been if the canvas was totally clean. So, if you‚Äôre able to wash your hair prior to getting it colored, even simply the night before, it‚Äôll certainly help set your stylist and the color up for success. If you aren‚Äôt able, your stylist should know whether or not he or she needs to prep your hair with a wash or if it‚Äôs safe to simply apply the color directly to your hair.",
            "paragraph7": "In order to avoid confusion, if you‚Äôre going in for JUST a haircut, it‚Äôs okay to skip washing prior to your appointment. Your stylist may prefer to cut your hair dry, or simply want to wash it themselves. Also, washing your hair and showing up to your appointment with wet hair will not lead to a lower price of the service either!"

            "paragraph4": "I always wash my hair after I get out of the pool. Sometimes immediately after, and other times it‚Äôll be a few hours after depending on what we have going on. I typically apply a hair mask or at the very least I‚Äôll add in a leave-in conditioner and let my hair air dry.",
            "paragraph5": "But before all of this, before I get in the sun, I take a few steps to take care of my hair. More often than not I‚Äôll wear a hat. And I just bought a few scarves on amazon to try this summer to cover my hair when I‚Äôm out by the pool. As far as hair products go, I love the Bumble and Bumble Hairdressers Invisible Oil UV protection line. I‚Äôve been using the primer for months, and really love the hyaluronic acid leave-in treatment too. I also rounded up a few other UV protection hair products to pack in your pool or beach bag this summer and included a recommendation for what to apply afterward too."

I like dry shampoo, I do, but I think a bit more education and awareness about it could help make the use of it better for hair and scalp health! As always, your personal hairstylist is the best option for discussing your scalp health, dry shampoo use, etc. since that person sees you regularly. I hope this post gives you a few tips, and you leave with a recommendation or two for dry shampoo!",
            "paragraph2": "Dry shampoo is a really fantastic option for extending the life of your hairstyle to skip a wash day. Not only is this a time-saver, but it can save your hair from a bit of heat styling as well! There are so many different kinds, and it really takes a bit of trial and error to find a system that works for you. Dry shampoo can help soak up oil, leaving the hair both feeling and looking cleaner, as well as adding a little lift and texture to the roots of your hair. I‚Äôve never loved dry shampoo. It‚Äôs FINE, but I‚Äôve always leaned more towards making time for a wash and fresh style instead of trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù two-day-old hair. Call me old-fashioned, but it‚Äôs just what I preferred.",
            "paragraph3": "I did discover a product that I really loved in the summer months a few years ago by Bumble and Bumble which was the perfect post-workout ‚Äúdry‚Äù shampoo mist. I used quotation marks because it was a wet spray, but dang it really helped refresh my hair to a manageable level after a very, very sweaty workout. The Pret-a-Powder Post Workout Dry Shampoo mist was my go-to to spray on my sweaty hair, let it sit, and then blow dry on a day I wasn‚Äôt interested in styling my hair. Usually, it was in a ponytail anyway, but that product helped it look better. It does have a strong scent, so keep that in mind.  Over time, I would occasionally, and I mean occasionally, use dry shampoo, but I never felt super attached to it.",
            "paragraph4": "I was at a hair appointment a few months ago and my stylist wondered out loud if I was burning my hair a bit through the use of heat, which was contributing to the darker blonde that would occur over time. I certainly use a lot of heat on my hair, but even with heat protection and deep conditioners and repairing treatments, the temperature of the tools can still dramatically affect your hair.",
            "paragraph5": "Living Proof Dry Shampoo ($28) ‚Äì it should shock no one that this was the clear winner for me. Living Proof has just absolutely nailed dry shampoo. It works, it makes my hair feel full and fresh, it‚Äôs got a light scent, and it didn‚Äôt cause my scalp to itch. I was so pleased with the volume that lasted all day from this dry shampoo. I know they have the Advanced Clean Dry Shampoo as well, which I haven‚Äôt tried yet but people seem to really love it.",
            "paragraph6": "Amika Perk Up Dry Shampoo ($26) ‚Äì this is a really nice option for someone who found Living Proof Dry Shampoo to be too intense/gritty. This feels like nothing in your hair, in the best way possible, but don‚Äôt expect it to add volume or lift.",
            "paragraph7": "Batiste Dry Shampoo, Bare Fragrance (under $10) ‚Äì this was another great option for a barely-there scent and lightweight finish. I got zero lift/volume from this product, so if you‚Äôre not looking for volume on day 2 or 3, and prefer a minimal scent, this would be a nice option!"

            "paragraph3": "I‚Äôve been using GHD flat irons for years, both in the salon and at home, and while they don‚Äôt give you options to adjust heat, they are some of the fastest, smoothest, highest-performing irons out there.",
            "paragraph4": "I used the new GHD Platinum+ iron for these waves (this is not a sponsored post, but the brand did gift me this iron). It‚Äôs fantastic. It has a top heat of 365 degrees, which is safe for most hair, and an auto-shutoff after 30 minutes. The beveled edge of the plates means it smooths through the hair effortlessly, which is essential for a ‚Äúone and done‚Äù pass through the hair. Repeatedly ironing over a section of hair can cause damage, so if you‚Äôre able to get a smooth, straight effect (or a wave!) with one glide against the hair, that‚Äôs a sign of a great iron.",
            "paragraph5": "In the video, I used the GHD Platinum+ iron, the Cricket Pro-35 comb, Virtue Healing Oil for the ends, and Amika Un.Done Volume and Matte Texture Spray for texture and grit. Prior to the start of the video, I used Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser‚Äôs Invisible Oil Ultra Rich Hyaluronic Treatment Lotion, as well as Aquage Uplifting Foam on my roots for lift.",
            "paragraph6": "In my experience, this is one of those hairstyles that looks different every time you try it. Some days it‚Äôs softer waves, other days you‚Äôll have a stronger bend. A lot depends on how you prep the hair, how quickly your iron flows through the sections, and what finishing products you use as well.",

            "paragraph1": "Human hair extensions are exactly what they sound like. They are made out of real, human hair from top to bottom, collected from a donor. Remy hair means all the cuticles (the outer layer of the hair) are intact, running in the same direction at the time of collection. This allows for almost no tangling and ensures that the extensions remain smooth and silky throughout their lifetime.  Synthetic hair, on the other hand, is made out of various synthetic, blended fibres, and contains no human hair. These fibres are usually very fine, plastic fibres that are manufactured to imitate real human hair.",
            "main2": "LOOK & FEEL",
            "paragraph2": "Both real and synthetic extensions come in many styles, colours, and different forms of application. The quality of synthetic fibres can vary, but they are generally stiff and move differently from human hair, so they don‚Äôt blend as well with your natural hair. They sometimes have a wiry or coarse feel to the touch. Real hair looks and feels real (because it is!) and therefore blends more naturally with your hair.  ",
            "main3": "COLORING & STYLING",
            "paragraph3": "Human hair extensions can be treated just like your own natural hair. You can straighten, curl, blow dry, color them, and apply hair products. With synthetic hair, you cannot color the hair as most dyes contain ammonia or bleach, which would destroy the synthetic hair. Additionally, you cannot style synthetic hair the same way as your real hair because heat can damage them so curling irons, straighteners and blow dryers are a no go, as they will melt or severely damage the hair. Other factors such as sun, friction, or harsh hair products can also damage synthetic hair extensions. ",
            "main4": "QUALITY & HOW LONG HAIR EXTENSIONS LAST",
            "paragraph4": "Synthetic hair is cheaper than real hair, but of course with that, comes a trade-off. Because they‚Äôre made out of synthetic fibres, they do not last as long as human hair as they can easily be damaged by the above-mentioned factors (sun, heat, etc.) Generally, synthetic hair extensions last for a few months, whereas human hair extensions can last upwards of one year if they are well taken care of. Luxy Hair remy human hair extensions last for about one year on average. "
