            "paragraph1": "I was the girl that brought the cooking pan to college. I still can't believe I ACTUALLY thought I would cook in the dorm kitchen. It was one of those things that I was so stubborn about buying because I was convinced that I would use it all the time. That pan was just one example of something I brought to college that I never touched. There were many other things that I spent money on and I never used (honestly, still haven't even touched them to this day!).",
            "paragraph2": "Make sure to check if your dorm room needs a microwave or not. A microwave is literally a saving grace in college. I needed to bring my own microwave freshman year and the dorm supplied a microwave sophomore year. Check your dorm website before you go just to make sure!",
            "important": "WHAT NOT TO BRING TO COLLEGE:",
            "paragraph3": "One of my biggest mistakes freshman year was paying Home Good's rent with the number of throw pillows I bought from them for my dorm room. I LOVE throw pillows. I loved them then and still love them now. However, my throw pillows and I went through a little bit of a rocky stage in my dorm room because I brought so many dang pillows and had nowhere to put them! After doing that for a semester, I now recommend you stick with two throw pillows on your bed (at max) and one or two on your futon. That's IT. You will regret having any more than that!",
            "paragraph4": "Having a printer in college is a big pain in the butt. I never actually brought a printer to school but I had friends who did and always complained about it getting in the way.            It's almost guaranteed that your dorm will have printers available for you to use. I have never heard of a dorm room these days that doesn't have a printer available to the students living there. Another pro to not bringing a printer to school - printer ink can be expensive! Use the printing credits you receive as part of your tuition (you do pay for them after all ;).",
            "paragraph5": "I am about to give you a secret/life-changing product: Downy Wrinkle Releaser. I just discovered this past year and can't believe I didn't know about it earlier! This little spray works SO well. All you do is spray it on clothes that are super wrinkly, pull it tight so the shirt doesn't show wrinkles anymore, and let go. The wrinkles will be GONE!  It is so cool!! My roommates and I went through every wrinkled shirt in my closet because we were so amazed it actually worked. It completely replaces a need for an iron or ironing board (and removes the risk of you putting a big burn hole in one of your favorite shirts ;).",
            "paragraph6": "Like I said earlier in this post, I was 'one of those' that brought a pan to school thinking I would make full-on meals all the time.  Be realistic about what you are bringing to school. Me thinking I would find a way to the grocery store every week to buy chicken and other ingredients to make with that pan WITHOUT A CAR to even get me there was dumb and not very thought out. (This is obviously a different situation if you have a medical issue where you need to make your own food. If that's the case, you should definitely bring a pan and ignore all info in the previous two paragraphs üôÇ )"
